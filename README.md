# time_keeper_gui
Python gui application for personal time tracking.

* This is a fairly minimal gui/db application designed to track jobs, work shifts, and tasks. (Runs on MacOS and Linux, hasn't been tested in Windows yet)
* It features a small home-pane that lets you add jobs, start shifts, and open the Report and Edit pane.
* Shift pane displays shift info such as job name and elappsed time, and features notes textbox, add new task, and pause/resume for when you need a break.
* Report and Edit displays jobs, shifts, and tasks, and allows you to open the ViewEdit pane for table item.

$python3 run.py will launch the program

Support for tasks is currently under construction. Once implemented, you will be able to create titled tasks, add comments, and mark as complete. Tasks will be searchable in the Report and Edit pane.
