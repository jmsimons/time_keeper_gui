	Goodorganics: Discussing options with Roger.  Moving forward with

	Goodorganics: Recieved response from SEDO customer support.  It's
	okay to park a domain while in a direct auction.  Sellers' and
	bidders'/buyers' usernames are never revealed, bid amounts are
	revealed with 'bidder1: $amount', 'bidder2: $amount'.

RogerGood		2020/07/30 15:35:27		1.04		Notes:
	Email Security: Checking contents of phishing email, seems to be
	plain text without any other artifacts, phishing-link=https://cady-
	oil.com/goodrealtymanagement.  Recommendation is to look through
	settings and ensure that no email or other data is being forwarded
	anywhere unexpected, ensure that home network is secure, scan for
	malware on computers used for email access(malwarebytes), enable TLS
	in all current access methods (what kind of email clients are being
	used for access?)

RogerGood		2020/07/31 13:09:09		0.66		Notes:
	Email Security: looked up cady-oil.com/goodrealtymanagement on
	checkphish.ai and brightcloud.com, neither had any information on
	past malicious activity.  The web address returns an 'account
	suspended' redirect which doesn't seem totally legitimate.

	@ 2:30) talk to godaddy support.         POP3, IMAP, MAPI access
	settings and security  Lunch on Friday.

RogerGood		2020/08/04 09:58:28		0.26		Notes:
	Email Security: Questions for GoDaddy support: 1. Does godaddy have a
	protocol for this type of thing?  2. Can we get a list of POP3 or
	IMAP server requests?
